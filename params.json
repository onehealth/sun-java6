{"name":"sun-java6","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nDue to licensing problems Java 6 was recently removed from Debian\r\ntesting and Debian stable/oldstable was stuck with Java 6u26. Given\r\nsecurity updates in later Java versions, this leaves no choice, but\r\nmanual Java update (OpenJDK not being an alternative for many).\r\n\r\nI didn't like the idea of installing Java by hand on my Debian\r\nsystems, so I've looked for updated Java packages. As I was unable to\r\nfind ones, I've decided to make my own, so I've pulled latest package\r\nsources from the Debian Subversion repository and adapted it to the\r\nlatest Java 6.\r\n\r\n### Supported Debian versions\r\n\r\nSo far packages were tested on following Debian versions:\r\n\r\n* wheezy i386/amd64\r\n* squeeze i386/amd64\r\n* lenny i386/amd64\r\n\r\nNew users of Debian Wheezy should cosider using [java-package](http://wiki.debian.org/JavaPackage).\r\n\r\nPackages are compatible with the \"official\" Debian ones. However, I've\r\nremoved a lot of obsolete code (dating back to etch), licensing stuff\r\n(since it does not apply anymore) and made general cleanups. For\r\ndetails of changes see 'changelog' file.\r\n\r\nI do not have resources to test packages on Ubuntu. However, if one\r\nfinds any problem on Ubuntu, feel free to report an issue and I will\r\ntry to resolve it.\r\n\r\nFor automated solution Ubuntu users can use [oab-java6](https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo create packages on your own:\r\n\r\n* apt-get install dpkg-dev\r\n* git clone git://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6.git\r\n* cd sun-java6\r\n* Download jdk-6u32-linux-i586.bin and jdk-6u32-linux-x64.bin from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\r\n  (yes, both, no matter which version you will run)\r\n* dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us\r\n* install any missing packages that dpkg-buildpackage complains about\r\n  and repeat\r\n\r\n### Legal\r\n\r\nOracle does not permit to distribute repackaged binaries of Java, so\r\nbe advised that hosting any public repository with Java packages is\r\nprobably illegal (at least in some parts of the world).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this repository contains only scripts, that allows\r\none to repackage Oracle Java in Debian friendly way. No binaries are\r\nor will be hosted.\r\n","tagline":"Up-to-date Java 6 packages for Debian","google":"UA-3445568-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
